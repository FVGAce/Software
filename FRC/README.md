# FRC

## Description
This section includes all files for my 3 years as the lead and sole programmer for my high school robotics FRC team 4592, M3. The first year is Stronghold, the following year is SteamWorks, and finally PowerUp (2018). As each year goes by, the coding style evolves and leads to more simplified and unified coding that is still used to this day. This includes making abstract classes that act as framework classes to build subsystems and autonomous modes. The years of Stronghold and SteamWorks the team went to the world championships. The year of SteamWorks we ended up being the highest ranked Florida team at the world championships. During SteamWorks I decided to listen to one of my mentors that had minimal experience in programming, this led to having a bug-filled autonomous mode, finally at the world championships I had enough time to change the code to work the way I thought of from the beginning which ended up making an autonomous that was very optimized and fast at doing its tasks. From this I learned to go with my gut a lot more when programming, which has treated me very well since then.
