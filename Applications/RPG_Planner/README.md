# RPG Planner

## Description
This project builds a planner application for android. The planner has the ability to add, delete, and edit courses. These courses can store assignments which can also be added, deleted, or edited. This is all done using android's room libraries, which is an abstraction of SQLite. This project was made part of a final project for Intro to Software Engineering. This code is missing a few aspects such as user setup and points that due to schedulinng couldn't be done. Though the parts that were done took about 2 days to make.
